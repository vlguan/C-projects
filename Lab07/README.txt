The lab is used to demonstrate the use of embedded
system from the UNO32 and to teach us the usefulness of 
states machine. The finite state machine is used to switch 
the modes of the oven. This summary does not differ from the 
lab manual. 

I had to write out a bunch of the cases for the oven, mapping out
state machine. Then I figured out the logic for the timer and worked
out how the logic for the display. After figuring out how the display
should look, I used the pseudo-code to construct the state machine
part by part. I read the manual thoroughly and it worked pretty well. 
Although the lab was very difficult and the logic was very hard. My
Roommate helped me with the c part of the logic, which helped me
greatly. 

I spent nearly the entire week on the lab. I think I did pretty well on the lab
,but I’m not sure if I have the best code that will run the fastest. I didn’t like
anything about this lab, the logic was difficult and the embedded systems
were hard. The point distribution is fair because the lab is so big and difficult.
The examples and in-class lectures helped me work out most of the logic.
