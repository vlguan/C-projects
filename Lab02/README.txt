1. If scanf(" ") executes, it will not have a restriction on the data type and not have a variable to place it in.
2. Restricting those lines of code in the function teaches us how to use the return. Its important to not allow
us to use certain lines of code to teach us a specific skill.
3. It took me about 2-3 hours I think. The hardest part of the lab was figuring out how to connect
my uno32 to my computer. I didn't realize I had to plug in two usbs into the PIC32kit and the 
UNO32.
