Intro:
This lab is used to demonstrate the usefulness of the different forms of sorting.
We created a linked list to implement the two forms of sorting. Selection sort 
iterates through the list and searches for items less than the original pointer. 
Insertion sort finds the item and places it in the correct position, ie a deck of
cards the 5, 1, 3, 2. The 1 will be placed first, the 2 will be placed in second,
3 in third, and 5 in fifth.
Hypothesis:
I believe the Insertion sort is faster than Selection sort because Selection sort
has to iterate through the entire list, when Insertion sort directly places the 
items in the correct places.
Data:
SelectionSort() time: 35.776 ms
InsertionSort() time: 19.34 ms
Analysis:
The important aspects of the lab is the understanding of Selection and Insertion 
Sort through the use of linked list. Selection and Insertion Sort is important in 
data structures in later classes. The lab manual implies the important aspects of 
the lab are to reinforce the use of pointers. I approached the lab by completing 
the linked list first, function by function. Then I tested if each of the functions 
worked. I started to work on the sort functions and testing them. Keeping track of 
the variable names I’ve created and where the pointers were gave me the most trouble. 
I had to test and change minute details to see if my code would produce the correct 
sort. I started earlier in this lab and finished on time. I was able to test and fix 
components that were essential to the code. The lab manual, class, and sections included 
enough material to start me off.
