1. The lab accepts RPN, reverse polish notation (1 1 + = 1 + 1), and teaches the basics of stacks and data structure.
The lab highlights the process of pushing and popping the data in a stack. I believe the lab manual presents the required
materials, but the lab was more difficult than expected.
2. I designed the stack first and tested if the stacked work using the stack tests. Then I started to flesh out my RPN
calculator and the mathematical operations. I tested the elements of the calculator using the RPN_TESTS I designed. 
I read the manual a couple times before starting the lab. The tas in lab really helped me with compiling my code and 
getting the correct logic. If I were to do the lab again I would've began earlier and read the lab a couple more times.
3. The results of my lab are kinda iffy and I wish I could've spent more time on it. There are points I couldn't achieve because 
I didn't spend enough time. I spent 2-3 days on the lab, but I still felt like the lab was more difficult than the manual suggested.
The point distribution is fair, but I really disliked how the lab doesn't factor in how long it takes to learn stacks and then under-
standing the RPN.
