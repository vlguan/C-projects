1. The lab tested the student on their ability to figure out the mathematics and logic to matric operations. The most important parts of the lab
were the usage of the libraries, and jumping between files and returning the correct values.
2. I checked if each mathematic operation I coded would produce the correct matrices. Then I worked on getting the MatrixEquals to work and from
there I wrote the code to print and construct the reader. If i could approach the lab differently, I would work on the MatrixEquals first because
I realized printing the matrices wouldn't always yield the correct matrix and I had to quickly finish the MatrixEquals inorder to check if my
matrices were correct.
3. I spent a good 5-6 hours on the Lab. I enjoyed creating the reader and designing something aetheically pleasing. However, I ran into a couple bugs
I couldn't squash. For example, I don't know why but when I was returning single values from the Determinant and Trace, my program would erase the value
of the return value and complete change my answer. I tested the function inside the Math file and I would get the correct number, but as soon as I 
tried to return the value into the test file, it would turn into a zero, making it useless to me. The examples in class did help me work towards my
final goal.
