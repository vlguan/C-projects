Vince Guan Colleagues: Conrad the TA

The lab is used to demonstrate the uses of the embedded systems of the UNO32.
 The lab provided practice, which we will need for the next lab. The lab also
 demonstrates the use of structs and helps us understand bitmasking.

I followed the instructions given to us by the lab manual and just followed 
the steps all the way through. I read the manual in parts that related to the 
parts I was completing. So if I was working on the third part, I would read the
 information on the ADC and the information about the noise. The lab manual was
 mildly helpful, I wish there were more direct instructions on how to call certain
 functions, but I guess reading the headers would do the same. The uno32 was slow
 and not as responsive as I wished it to be, so testing and making sure it worked 
would take up alot of time. The TAs were very helpful for this lab, the pseudo code 
they wrote really helped me finish the Buttons.c and Buttons_test.c quicker.

I spent at least 2-3 full days on the lab. I disliked the lab greatly because the
 uno32 was so unresponsive and slow with loading the code. Everytime I would want
 to try something new, it would bug out or take 3 years to load the next section of
 code. I like how this lab will help me understand the next lab more or better. The 
examples and pseudocode in lab was very useful and helped me through the toughest
 section of the lab.
