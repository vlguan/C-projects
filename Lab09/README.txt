MY REPO CONTAINS THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PROJECT.

I WROTE:
-AGENT.C
-AGENTTEST.C
-MESSAGE.C
-MESSAGETEST.C

Introduction:
    I received massive tutoring from my 3rd year cs 
major roommate. I explained embedded systems to him 
and he would walk me through the logic. He helped me 
come to my own conclusions and assisted in the debugging 
process. He never touched the keyboard or told me what to write, 
but guided me to come up with the code myself. 
How it worked:
    BattleBoats is a lab controlled by two uno32 boards 
connected by two pins. Both uno32’s have their own state 
machine that controls the challenging, accepting, attacking and 
defending. The game starts when one machine challenges the other. 
The challenge key is encoded and then sent to the other board to be decoded. 
The state machine is followed until one of the boards wins.
Testing: 
    The lab was very difficult all throughout, I had to start very early. 
Completing the lab solo was very difficult because I wasn’t able to communicate 
with someone working on the same parts. Not being able to go to Lab for the 
final days was also very tough, but thankfully Max gave us a python program 
that lets us test. The correct files given to us also helped me test a lot of 
the Agent issues. Using print statements was the best way for me to debug.
Learned:
    This lab taught me how to use checksums, state machines in details, 
encode and decode. The more complex state machine forced me to learn the 
more in-depth versions of state machines. I also didn’t know how the uno32 
would communicate with each other, but I chose the solo option.
Opinions:
    I really liked how much time was given to complete this lab. 
The addiction of the completed/correct files were also very useful.
